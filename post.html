                    <p>In our hectic modern world, many of us race from one to-do to the next, planning this and worrying about that. Thoughts and unconscious habits often consume us, numbing us to our true experience and to the suffering we create for ourselves and those around us. </p>

                    <p><b>How to break this cycle and come home to our bodies—and to the wonders of life found only in the present moment?</b></p>

                    <p>Your breath is the key. Learn exercises for using your breath to cease internal conflict, release tension and anxiety, and become aware of the conditions for happiness and freedom that are always available.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A bit of Science</h2>

                    <p>Our bodies and minds are profoundly inter-related. Our emotions are anchored in the body and integral to the autonomic nervous system which is the nerve complex that controls the involuntary actions of our internal organs, blood vessels and glands. Emotional balance is mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The way we move or hold our bodies can inform us of our emotional states and are evoked in tandem with sensations.</p>

                    <p>Physical symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ME, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, asthma or eczema, although unexplained medically, are understood generally to mean that we are unwell in our bodies. However, ground-breaking research into chronic unexplainable physical symptoms demonstrates that there is a complex and dense inter-connectedness between the brain and the body resulting in the conclusion that the idea of a split between body and mind is unhelpful (<i>Payne 2009a; 2009b; Payne and Stott 2010; Payne 2011</i>).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A bit Further</h2>

                    <p>Neuropsychology tells us that our thoughts are governed by our emotions which are, in turn, grounded in our bodies, emotions being part of self-regulation (<i>homeostasis</i>).</p>

                    <p>In adulthood it is often easier to lose the connection with these essential networks of communication which can enable us to cope with psychological physical injury/symptoms, stress and trauma (Fogal 2009). For example, if we can learn to explore the emotional content of our physical symptoms, even understand their purpose perhaps, we are more likely to be able to self-manage them.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      Descartes famously wrote:
                      <br />
                      <b>'I think, therefore I am'.</b>
                      <br />
                      However, following research into embodied cognition it is time to replace that claim with:
                      <br />
                      <b>'I move, therefore I think'.</b>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Meaning</h2>

                    <p>The Japanese expression <b>Ken Zen Ichi Nyo</b> is a widely Martial Arts term which literally translates as "The Fist and Zen are One".</p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="img-right" src="img/Ken-zen2.jpg" alt="kenzenichinyo" />The kanji (reading from top to bottom) means:
                        <br />
                        拳 "Fist" that represents the body;
                        <br />
                        禅 "Zen" that represents the mind or spirit;
                        <br />
                        一 "One" (one entity);
                        <br />
                        如 "Are".
                    </p>

                    <p>When the body fares poorly, one’s spirits tend to fall, and no matter how thoroughly one may set one’s soul at peace, this will not avert the decline of the body into illness. If the body and the spirit, then, are so inseparably intertwined, the training of either must be the training of both as one entity.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      Doshin So (the founder of Shorinji Kempo)  spoke of this concept not only as a matter of body and mind, but as a concept with meaning extending even to the relations of action an thought:
                      <br />
                      <b>“Zen is a thing of the mind and heart*. However, the whole matter is founded upon the body’s existence.“</b>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      * In Japan the heart is the home of will and not the feelings as in the west.
                    </blockquote>
